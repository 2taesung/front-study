# React.js와 비교해 주의해야할 점

When it comes to setting up the development environment, there are a few key differences between Next.js and React.js:

* In a Next.js project, pages are stored in the `pages` directory and automatically become routable. In React, routing must be set up manually using a package like `react-router`.

* Next.js comes with built-in support for CSS and Sass, while in React, developers need to use a separate package like `styled-components` or `CSS modules`. [\[4\]](https://ivorycode.tistory.com/entry/Nextjs%EB%A5%BC-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9C%A0)
* Next.js automatically optimizes images using the `next/image` component, while in React, developers need to use a separate package like `react-image` or `react-lazy-load-image-component`.
